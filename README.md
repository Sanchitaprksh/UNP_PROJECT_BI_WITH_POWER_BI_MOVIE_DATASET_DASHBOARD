# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_MOVIE_DATASET_DASHBOARD

As part of my internship with UNP Education, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze popular movies data. The dashboard provides insights into movie ratings, genres, and tags, enabling users to explore and visualize the data in a user-friendly manner.Through this project, I acquired hands-on experience in data cleaning, data analysis, and Power BI visualization, significantly enhancing my ability to interpret popular movies data effectively. This project has not only deepened my understanding of data analysis and visualization but also equipped me with practical skills in working with real-world data.To ensure transparency and facilitate future development, I have made the project files available on Github for reference.
